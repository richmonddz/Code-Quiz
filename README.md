# Description

Welcome to my Pokemon Quiz! This is a timed quiz and you only have 60 seconds to complete it. For ever wrong answer 5 seconds will be deducted from the timer! Building this quiz my goal was to make it look like ported out of Pokemon Red and Blue. To do that I used CSS and HTML, while JS took care of all the functionality.

To start the quiz you will have to click on the "Start Journey" button and it will populate the first quiz question and initiate the countdown timer. You will be given 4 answer choices for each question. The quiz will end when either all 8 questions are answered or the timer runs out. At the end of the quiz you will be prompted to input your initals to add them to the highscore board.
